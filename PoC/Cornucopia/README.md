# Cornucopia

a long time ago, there is a famous merchant who is said to be the richest man in the country.

people say that it is because he has a cornucopia.

when you put one into the cornucopia, you can get double from it.

one apple in then two apples out; one egg in then two eggs out; one wife in then two wives out;

...

and, **some $NEO in - double $NEO out**

where is the cornucopia?

it was dropped on the neo blockchain by the merchant.
